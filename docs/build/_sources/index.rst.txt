QCEngine
========

QCEngine is a quantum computer simulator accompanying the O'Reilly book `Programming Quantum Computers <https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683>`_. Needing no installation, QCEngine makes use of the *circle notation* introduced in the book, to provide a compelling pedagogical tool for learning to understand and build quantum circuits.

To get started with how to navigate and use the simulator, see the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart-label>`, or to see a list of useful QCEngine commands see the :ref:`cheatsheet <cheatsheet-label>`
