This page gives a summary of essential QCEngine commands. For more detail on how to combine these commands into full quantum programs see the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart-label>` section.


Setting up qubits
-----------------

:code:`qc.reset(num_qubits)`
    Reset the QPU and initialize it with :code:`num_qubits` qubits. |br|
    **Example:** :code:`qc.reset(4)`

:code:`qc.write(val)`
    Write the integer value :code:`val` in binary using all qubits in the QPU. |br|
    **Example:** :code:`qc.write(2)`

:code:`qint.new(num_qubits, qint_label)`
    Create a QInt with the first :code:`num_qubits` free in the QPU and label it with the string :code:`qint_label` in circuit diagrams. QInt's provide a way to group qubits together and act on them in these groups.|br|
    **Example:** :code:`qint.new(2, 'myqint')`

Single-qubit operations
-----------------------

Most single-qubit operations can either be performed as methods of the :code:`qc` object or of a :code:`qint` object. In either case, a specific qubit for the operation to act on can be specified using hexadecimal, or if no specific qubit is specified, the single-qubit operation is applied separately to all qubits in the object. When used as a :code:`qc` method, qubit specifications are relative to all qubits from the whole QPU. For :code:`qint` methods, qubit specifications are relative only to qubits in the :code:`qint`.

:code:`qc.had(qubit)` (alias :code:`qc.hadamard(qubit)`)
    Applies the Hadamard operation (HAD) to :code:`qubit`, creating an equal superposition when acted on :math:`|0\rangle`, and an equal superposition with a relative phase of :math:`180^{\circ}` when acted on :math:`|1\rangle`. Can also be acted on a qint as :code:`qint.had(qubit)`. When called without a specific qubit address, acts HAD operations on all qubits in the parent object. |br|
    **Example:** :code:`qc.had(0x2)`

:code:`qc.phase(qubit)`
    

Multi-qubit operations
----------------------
